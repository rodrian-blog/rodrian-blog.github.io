[{"content":"Today, I would like to talk about my connections with orienteering, which has now become one of my favorite sports.\nOrienteering is a sport where participants, using a map and a compass, navigate their way to a series of control points in a certain order. It is typically held in forests, parks, or university campuses. Orienteering originated in Sweden in the 19th century as a military sport and has now evolved into an outdoor competitive sport and recreational activity suitable for people of all ages.\nMy first encounter with orienteering was when I was in primary school. One day, my parents suddenly told me about an orienteering activity that was open to the public, taking place in the designated area within a scenic area. I went there, not really knowing what to expect, and joined a team with a few kids and adults. We made our way from one checkpoint to another at leisure, enjoying the view and ticking off each point.\nThis non-competitive play which is just for fun and experience planted a seed in my heart.\nMany years passed in the blink of an eye, and I crossed paths with orienteering again in college. To my surprise, I discovered that among a variety of sports courses, there was one called \u0026ldquo;campus orienteering.\u0026rdquo; The following year I was dedicated to physical education classes, and as a result, I got familiar with almost every corner of the campus in a short time because our classes were not held in fixed locations. It could be a lawn with many trees, could be on a hilltop of Bugao Hill, could be on an island in Mingyuan Lake, or could even cover the majority area of the campus. This semester, we have a elective course open to all undergraduate students about orienteering of 2 credits, which takes place in several tourist attractions in Sichuan. I really want to take this course, but what disappointed me a lot is that my schedule conflicts with the course. I hope to have the opportunity to experience this course next year. What is noteworthy is that the teacher who teaches this course also teaches many other cool courses, such as tree climbing, wilderness survival skills, and paragliding.\nIn addition to classes, Sichuan University also organizes a multitude of orienteering activities, some of which are held annually. I once participated in the “100-meter orienteering” final at the Autumn Sports Games, but unfortunately, I missed a control point and my grade was rendered invalid. What’s more, I participated in another large-scale orienteering competition held at the Wangjiang Campus. Although I didn\u0026rsquo;t win any prizes, I received a panda stuffed toy and a badge as souvenirs.\nBesides, we also has the Sichuan University Orienteering Alliance, and there is an orienteering team that requires selection to join. They also organize interesting activities and bring together many orienteers. This is wonderful!\n","date":"2023/10/17","image":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/orienteering/cover.jpg","permalink":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/orienteering/","summary":"Today, I would like to talk about my connections with orienteering, which has now become one of my favorite sports.\nOrienteering is a sport where participants, using a map and a compass, navigate their way to a series of control points in a certain order.

It is now used metaphorically to describe the fierce competition in promotional activities between student clubs, because \u0026ldquo;regiment\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;association\u0026rdquo; can be represented by the same Chinese character.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the time for annual association recruitment season again. Every year at this time, there are hundreds of clubs setting up booths on the Youth Square for promotion and the square will be bustling with noise and excitement the whole day. Previously, it lasted for two days, but this year it has been extended to three days.\nThere is only one day available for small organizations to publicize themselves. We directors went early in the morning to complete a series of tasks, such as carrying tables and chairs, setting up the booth, hanging flags and posters, paying a deposit. Everything was ready before the large crowd came to visit. At around 8 p.m., we closed the booth, dragging our tired bodies.\nA kind-hearted club was willing to exchange time and location with us, so we were lucky to become neighbors with our friend association Red Anime Club, which shares some similar interests with our club. Additionally, because the Red Anime Club attracts a sea of people, we also received a portion of their popularity. This year, their welcome QQ group has over a thousand members, while we have over two hundred members, breaking the previous record.\nOur association\u0026rsquo;s welcome events have become more and more diverse each year. This year, we have a exciting prize quiz, chances to try out game demos developed by club members, and take photos with our cosplayer. I mainly host the segment of the prize quiz, actively introduce the club to people who are interested and answer their questions. We collected numerous questions from club members and they are quite challenging. However, due to the high difficulty level, we have lowered some of the criteria for winning prizes to ensure that everyone has a enjoyable experience.\nIndeed, this time is pure and joyful. As one of the club leaders, it is a great experience to introduce what I am familiar with and passionate about to others. We feel even better if they can resonate with us. Besides, Sharing some insights and experiences in our areas of expertise is a pleasure chance. Although constantly interacting with people can be exhausting, I am more than willing to do.\n","date":"2023/10/15","image":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/baituan/cover.jpg","permalink":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/baituan/","summary":"The Hundred Regiment Campaign was a famous battle during the period of Chinese resistance against Japan.

Not long ago, the new museum of Sichuan University was completed and put into operation, after being closed for four years. I hope I can have the chance to visit soon. Besides, Chengdu Natural History Museum of Chengdu University of Technology is now requiring tickets, no longer free. I was lucky enough to go there when it needed reservation for free tours. What’s more, I visited Natural History Museum of National University of Singapore, which is small but have a sea of specimens. In addition, when I stayed at Tsinghua University, I found several museums operated by universities nearby.\nI have visited some natural history museums and see lots of similarities among them. For example, the display of a tremendous amount of biological specimens is a must. Also, there are giant models or skeletons capturing your attention.\nHere, I\u0026rsquo;m going to mainly talk about Chengdu Natural History Museum of Chengdu University of Technology, as a travelogue. It\u0026rsquo;s really hard to snag up an appointment on a busy weekend!\nFrom the outside, it has a well-designed, sculpted exterior with a sense of modernity. Inspired by the western Sichuan Mountains, the design team incorporated the towering snow-capped mountains into the museum\u0026rsquo;s appearance.\nThe whole museum is divided into one underground floor and four above-ground floors, including 6 permanent and 2 temporary exhibition halls. The theme of the first floor is minerals and gems. Minerals never fail to amaze me with their splendid and shiny appearance. I love the pallasite most, which awakened my imagination of stars falling through darkness. In addition, a glass display case contains some minerals that can glow, including Opal, Aragonite, Calcite and Pyrite. I remember when I learned chemistry in high school, my teacher talked about the flame reaction, which has various colors like this. Next, walking up to the second floor, we came to the world of dinosaurs. There are more than 30 dinosaur fossils, both authentic ones and replicas. In specific lights, the already huge dinosaurs appear even more tall and powerful. A large part of dinosaurs have incredibly long necks and makes people couldn’t help wondering how the body support its neck.\nIn the end, we come to the third floor, where the topics of exhibition halls revolve around biodiversity. There are numerous specimens of animals, all in different poses, some combined well with the landscapes. Although it’s carefully arranged and worth appreciating, large areas of grand scene specimen exhibition is so common in natural history museums and do not excite my mind. I have to roast that some specimens are ugly, such as capybara, one of my favorite animals. In conclusion, overall it was a nice museum with rich exhibits, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel the urge to go again, not to mention it is said that now have to queue for long time to get in after buying tickets.\n","date":"2023/10/10","image":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/museum/cover.jpg","permalink":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/museum/","summary":"Nowadays, more and more universities have their own museum.

Hopefully I can have the chance to visit all of them in the near future. Different from the elegant and gentle view of Jiangnan(south of the Yangtzi River) with misty rain, the scenery there is magnificent landscape with towering mountains and wide waters.\nAround May Day’s holiday, numerous tour groups are promoting their tourism products that are attractive hoppingly. Since Chengdu is near Aba Prefecture (within a 9-hour coach ride), tourist attractions there are popular destinations.\nIt’s a pity that I couldn’t go to since I have to go back to hometown, but it recalls my journey to Huanglong and Jiuzhai Valley during May Day Holiday. Jiuzhai Valley is as charming as expected, and maybe because it covers such a huge area, the scene spot could accommodate the terrible flow of people during May Day well and have a nice experience. However, the visit to Huanglong National Scenic Spot left a lot of regrets.\nThere’re two ways to go to the peak: on foot or by cable car. I strongly recommend you to take a cable car unless you’re a mountaineering enthusiast, since scene spots are just alongside mountain paths and tourists go up and hike down share the same route. But then came my first regret, which is about the cable car. Confusingly, there’s a distance of 2.4km between the cableway station and hiking trail, and you can choose to walk or pay for the shuttle bus. But the footpath is very close to the driveway, and there isn’t much view. After arriving at the trail, you still need to climb up for around 1km to reach the peak and enjoy the most important tourist attraction - Colorful Pools. The good news is that Colorful Pools fit descriptions and are impressive. What’s more, when the sun shone on the top of the snow-capped mountain, I feel that my soul is purified.\nHowever, then the journey was full of regrets. It was until I reached the foot of the mountain that I watched a notice and realized May Day is still in the off-season. In that the vast majority of places of interest in Huanglong depend heavily on water, while currently during the dry season, I could only see the exposed bottoms of pools. At most places, a sign explaining the attraction was erected nearby and I had to imagine its beauty since there is no or little water. The few sights I was able to enjoy were far from the beauty of their prime.\nI sincerely encourage others visiting Huanglong during busy-season to fully experience its charm.\n","date":"2023/10/07","image":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/huanglong/cover.jpg","permalink":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/huanglong/","summary":"In Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, northwest of China, there are various beautiful and spectacular tourist attractions, including Jiuzhai Valley, Siguniang Mountain and Dagu Holy-glacier.

Although geographically speaking, the time for darkness to fall in cities and suburbs should be similar, here you will feel that darkness comes early.\nWhen I go out for some fresh air after finishing dinner - it is before 7 o\u0026rsquo;clock - I suddenly encounter dense darkness, realizing that this is a very different experience. Although both Sichuan and Jiangsu provinces use Beijing time, there exists some difference in the actual time due to the gap in longitude and other factors. Besides, even though Shuangliu District is not as developed as the city center, it still faces light pollution that cannot be ignored. But in areas where scattered houses are surrounded by rice fields, it isn’t a concern. Therefore, being able to witness such peaceful and pure darkness at this time is precious. I regulate my daily routine based on the biological clock, so it’s cozy and relaxing as the daylight indicates “time for rest”.\nOutside the courtyard, there are only several scattered sources of light, creating a stark contrast with the brightness inside the house. Moreover, with darkness comes silence, which make you feel as if the world is separated. Without many streetlights or any other light sources, even the familiar dirt road in the daytime seems unfamiliar, stretching into the unknown distance.\nThe pure darkness brings back my remote memories that my father took me on midnight adventures in the wilderness. All we have is a flashlight and a camera for equipment. Due to the minimal air pollution, the sky was clear and adorned with numerous stars. With a tripod set up, you could easily capture star trails. Aside from capturing the starry sky, you could also take photos of the pumping unit, commonly known as a \u0026ldquo;nodding donkey,\u0026rdquo; which still worked tirelessly in the dark night.\n","date":"2023/10/04","image":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/dark/cover.jpg","permalink":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/dark/","summary":"It gets dark early in the evening in the countryside.

However, some unique characteristics are still preserved. It is worth highlighting that the entire process has now been significantly compressed in terms of time, so it can be finished within a day.\nIn the daytime, we have already set up the room in advance. We put up many \u0026ldquo;囍\u0026rdquo; characters, tied colorful ribbons, and placed balloons filled with shiny confetti. At the same time, we also arranged four Chinese characters made of fruits that spell out \u0026ldquo;早生贵子\u0026rdquo; (meaning \u0026ldquo;May the couple have children soon\u0026rdquo;). The four kinds of dried fruits is jujube, peanut, longan and lotus seed.In Chinese, the pronunciation of these four characters is the same as the names of these four ingredients. Indeed, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit unusual that the entire following process started from midnight.\nIn the evening, the groom first went to the bride\u0026rsquo;s home after worshiping ancestors. The bride\u0026rsquo;s family would open the door for the groom only after receiving red envelopes. Then, the bride and groom played many mini-games together, such as ring toss, which helped strengthen their bond. In addition to these activities, there are also two meal breaks to prevent exhaustion. During the period, we captured lots of footage, and edited it into a video to be shown at the wedding.\nNext, it\u0026rsquo;s the turn to have the ceremony at the groom\u0026rsquo;s side. Ten relatives from the husband’s side went together to fetch the bride. At the entrance of the house, many firecrackers were set off to welcome. Then, the couple walked on the red carpet, scattered with flower petals and reeds. In the dialect here, reeds have a homophone related to wealth and prosperity. After that, it is the time for the bride family to display the dowry, which includes several quilts, cash (packed in bright red suitcases) and other stuff. An indispensable traditional ritual is the three bows. After completing these rituals, the newlyweds were sent to the bridal chamber, where the groom lifted the red veil and have sweet jujube soup and sticky rice balls. The homophones symbolize sweetness and togetherness.\nThe next ritual, traditionally performed several days later, is the \u0026ldquo;returning home\u0026rdquo; ceremony, which is the time for visiting the bride’s parents. However, due to simplification, it was now conducted in the afternoon of the same day.\nFinally, it is time to host the banquet and entertain the guests. At the restaurant, a host is hired to preside over the ceremony, and then the usual set of procedures followed.\nWish my brother and his wife love for all seasons!\n","date":"2023/10/03","image":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/wedding/cover.jpg","permalink":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/wedding/","summary":"Recently, my brother is getting married, and we are helping with the preparations and participating in the wedding.\nIn this modern era, traditional folk customs and practices have indeed been simplified to a great extent and are no longer too strict.

Some beautiful wildflowers are still blooming, the sky is clear blue, and as far as eyes can see, it is still a sea of green. Of course, the most prominent view is the vast expanse of paddy fields (Oryza sativa) with rice approaching maturity. The golden grains of rice are drooping their heads when gently swinging in the breeze. It signifies that the season of harvest is approaching.\nThe sunlight is great today, so many golden rays shine down, illuminating the interwoven rice leaves, creating a wonderful play of light and shadow. When the wind comes, shadows chase after each other.\nIn my mind, the best perspective to watch this is to squat down and look up, facing towards the sun. Sometimes, lowering your posture can help you observe the world better and see familiar things in a different angle, right?\nIt is not only rice that is lowering their heads, but also the same for sunflowers. The flowers are taller than me, as well as bigger than plates, and their discs are filled with seeds. Perhaps because it is born in a alleyway that doesn\u0026rsquo;t receive constant sunlight, and perhaps because the burden of its harvest is too heavy, it no longer lifts its head to follow the sun, but staring at the ground. Its stem has a significant bending angle, and this is also sunflower’s way of survival. I know, it\u0026rsquo;s also a season full of expectation.\nAfter countless days and nights, I finally stand upon this land - the nature world intertwined with the traces of humanity. It recalls me of my distant, natural bond with earth and land, since I have been living in big cities, year after year. Far away from the countryside, from the wild, from the ground beneath my feet.\nReincarnation can begin at any moment - alos this very moment, the moment of harvest. The fruits are harvested, fields are cleared, and new seeds are planted once again.\nHowever, at this moment, I am more willing to let go of all the cluttered thoughts and quietly watch the rare rainbow with the setting sun.

Therefore, it is awesome for us to gather two or three tables together every year. Therefore, I’m very grateful to several generations of active organizers. This is the third time I came to dinner together, which accompanied me throughout my university journey.\nAs we have radically different dietary habits compared to Sichuan, we choose restaurants that lean towards mild flavors, rather than spicy ones.

We come from different grades, majors, and cities, but we can naturally engage in conversation with each other. At the table I am sitting at, there are many fellow-townspeople who have been here for more than just this year, and we are more familiar with each other.\nAfter the lunch, it’s the special program that remains consistent every year. Unlike in Sichuan where mahjong is popular, not many of us know how to play it. Instead, during the Chinese New Year, it is more common to see people playing poker. However, we are also very willing to learn from fellow-villager who know how to play and experience the joy of playing mahjong.

Summer is in full swing, with large patches of green leaves in the lotus pond. The evening sun is still bright, creating a vibrant scene. The shadows of trees are cast upon the ruins of the Western-style palaces built of stone.\nSince my classes didn’t finish until late afternoon, I can only go sightseeing in the evening. However, there are not many attractions that are open at night. However, what made me happy is that this led to my encounter with the photo below. I think it has a photography magazine-like feel, even though I just took it casually with my phone🥰.\nThe main building of the Temple of Heaven, the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest (祈年殿), holds a unique charm at night, and capturing such a scene also requires certain conditions. Due to the closure of the Temple of Heaven Park at 22:00, and the closure of its attractions at 18:00, most of the time, visitors can only view the night scenery from outside the palace\u0026rsquo;s walls, so This photo was taken from the back of the palace.

It seems there are a few strange bird calls, accompanied by hoarse growls, by my ears, and I’m unsure of where they come. Suddenly, it becomes quiet again, causing my heart to tighten, and my steps seem to hesitate. This is what I felt of entering Night Safari after dusk, and these feelings are novel and unforgettable.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a wonderful summer evening, so the sky hadn\u0026rsquo;t turned dark yet when I arrived at 7 p.m. I chose to watch the show first, but now I sincerely advise visitors to take the sightseeing train first (especially when it\u0026rsquo;s still early in the evening)!\nI paid the price for my naivety because after watching the show, I headed straight to the station but ended up waiting for over an hour on a hot and humid evening. However, it can be quite interesting to observe faces from all around the world while waiting in line, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nThe sightseeing train moves slowly and there are audio introductions. It will stop in front of specific exhibition areas, and I leaned forward to get a better look. In the almost pitch-black night, with the specific lighting on the animal friends in those areas, their familiar figures seemed to become unfamiliar.\nAlthough lions are nocturnal animals, the three I saw were all sleeping\u0026hellip; There are many animals that I have already seen, but there are also some special ones, and one of them is my favorite during the adventure! What animal is black and white in color?\nGiant Panda? No! It’s Malayan tapir!!!\nI found this picture online because The train left before I had a perfect chance to take a photo. And they are one of the few animals that cannot be seen on footpaths, which is a great pity :(. After completing a tour on the train, I embarked on the footpath. It\u0026rsquo;s a great design because it surrounds the park, so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to walk the same route again. Despite the crowds at the train station, I can hardly see people walking on footpath. Thus, I felt like it’s a real jungle adventure, and I was part of this place. The street lamps cast a soft light, just illuminating the path, while the areas touched by darkness remain mysterious. Restricted vision brought about improved hearing, amplifying various sounds around the ears. My mind told me that I’m safe in a zoo, but you couldn’t help but be afraid and suspicious of what might come out of the dense woods.\nI really love the design of Night Safari. Many areas do not have glass walls, only a railing separates you from the animals. There are also some enclosed houses where you can go in and fully experience the animals\u0026rsquo; living environment. I clearly remember that there was a house raising giant bats that you could step into, and in the darkness I can only hear the sound of bats flying overhead and the flapping of their wings. Another house raised some kangaroos, and this is the first time I met with them at night. However, some animals have hidden themselves away and are nowhere to be found in the darkness. It’s a great pity that I had to sprint to complete the second half of the journey because I need to catch the last subway train. But overall it was an amazing adventure, and I want to go again!\n","date":"2023/09/10","image":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/night/cover.jpg","permalink":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/night/","summary":"In front of me is a mass of blackness, with dense and ever-changing tree shadows.

Now, I’m eager to write this review to look back at the good time spent with it. Actually, it’s the third time I watch the documentary, but still I couldn’t hold back tears.\nAll it tells is about the story between the photographer and octopus. Following the protagonist Craig Foster, also the film-maker, I dive into the clear waters, weaving through lush kelp forests. It is destined to encounter that octopus and peer into her life. I’m witnessing and experience the story of love.\nAs an environmental protection-themed documentary, it doesn’t shows us the harsh and impressive real-world issues, such as extensive white pollution, Marine creatures entangled in fishing nets. Instead, it’s just the experience that a human come to form a special relationship with a intelligent marine creature. Craig maintains a respectful distance between humans and wildlife at the most time, ensuring minimal disturbance and leave them undisturbed. Not just limited to those two, but the relationship extend to more areas, like the family bond, or with all creatures. Behind the story lies a deeper realm of contemplative space.\nMost of the time, the emotional impact it gives is mild. But it is not boring; instead, it gently narrates to you, immersing you in its story-telling and naturally capturing your heart. However, there are also moments when it makes you feel intense emotions, that feeling of powerlessness. To be more specific, there’s two event make me feel heart-broken, though I clearly know those are something bound to happen, and I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t intervene too much.\nOne is that a shark targeted its prey, tracing the octopus, biting her. I tell myself that this is a natural occurrence in the hunting behavior of animals, struggling to suppress the desire to rescue her. But I still couldn’t help thinking that if she is going to meet me and result in being chased by the predator. Fortunately, she is so intelligent and brave that she escaped finally. Another is that the mating begins, just a stage of her life. The lifespan of an octopus is only 1 to 3 years in average, so after spending over a year together, the time of separation arrived. She will complete its reproductive mission at the end of life. Hatching and nurturing the next generation is timing her death. Finally, she was barely alive, and became so weak that was washed out of the den, bitten by fishes. At last, a shark carried her in mouth and swam towards misty forests. I didn’t do anything, just a heart-broken bystander.\nAt the begin of the documentary, Craig was torn by life, sick from pressure and couldn’t be a good father. When chasing and documenting the lives of people thriving in the wilderness, he says, “I mean, they just were inside of the natural world. And I could feel I was outside. And I had this deep longing to be inside that world.”\nWhile near the end, he learned something from his octopus teacher. “To sense how vulnerable these wild animals’ lives are, and actually, then how vulnerable all our lives on this planet are.” “What she taught me was to feel, that you’re part of this place, not a visitor. That’s a huge difference.”\nAlthough it had already passed away, it passed on its vitality to the next generation. In the end, Craig met the young octopuses, and he couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder if they were descendants of her. This is not just a story of, but also a story about life. We can feel the vibrant vitality, the endless cycle of regeneration, and the rhythm of life.\n","date":"2023/09/07","image":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/my-octopus-teacher/cover.png","permalink":"https://rodrian-blog.github.io/posts/my-octopus-teacher/","summary":"It is a serendipitous surprise that I met this film, or rather, documentary, and it soon touched my heart deeply.
