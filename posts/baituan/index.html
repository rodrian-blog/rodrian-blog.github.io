          <p><em>The Hundred Regiment Campaign was a famous battle during the period of Chinese resistance against Japan. It is now used metaphorically to describe the fierce competition in promotional activities between student clubs, because &ldquo;regiment&rdquo; and &ldquo;association&rdquo; can be represented by the same Chinese character.</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the time for annual association recruitment season again. Every year at this time, there are hundreds of clubs setting up booths on the Youth Square for promotion and the square will be bustling with noise and excitement the whole day. Previously, it lasted for two days, but this year it has been extended to three days.<br>

<p>There is only one day available for small organizations to publicize themselves. We directors went early in the morning to complete a series of tasks, such as carrying tables and chairs, setting up the booth, hanging flags and posters, paying a deposit. Everything was ready before the large crowd came to visit. At around 8 p.m., we closed the booth, dragging our tired bodies.</p>
<p>A kind-hearted club was willing to exchange time and location with us, so we were lucky to become neighbors with our friend association Red Anime Club, which shares some similar interests with our club. Additionally, because the Red Anime Club attracts a sea of people, we also received a portion of their popularity. <em>This year, their welcome QQ group has over a thousand members, while we have over two hundred members, breaking the previous record.</em></p>
<p>Our association&rsquo;s welcome events have become more and more diverse each year. This year, we have a exciting prize quiz, chances to try out game demos developed by club members, and take photos with our cosplayer. I mainly host the segment of the prize quiz, actively introduce the club to people who are interested and answer their questions. We collected numerous questions from club members and they are quite challenging. However, due to the high difficulty level, we have lowered some of the criteria for winning prizes to ensure that everyone has a enjoyable experience.<br>

<p>Indeed, this time is pure and joyful. As one of the club leaders, it is a great experience to introduce what I am familiar with and passionate about to others. We feel even better if they can resonate with us. Besides, Sharing some insights and experiences in our areas of expertise is a pleasure chance. Although constantly interacting with people can be exhausting, I am more than willing to do.</p>
