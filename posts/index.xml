      <description>In front of me is a mass of blackness, with dense and ever-changing tree shadows. It seems there are a few strange bird calls, accompanied by hoarse growls, by my ears, and I’m unsure of where they come. Suddenly, it becomes quiet again, causing my heart to tighten, and my steps seem to hesitate. This is what I felt of entering Night Safari after dusk, and these feelings are novel and unforgettable.</description>

      <description>It is a serendipitous surprise that I met this film, or rather, documentary, and it soon touched my heart deeply. Now, I’m eager to write this review to look back at the good time spent with it. Actually, it’s the third time I watch the documentary, but still I couldn’t hold back tears.
All it tells is about the story between the photographer and octopus. Following the protagonist Craig Foster, also the film-maker, I dive into the clear waters, weaving through lush kelp forests.</description>
