          <p>The moon, as a symbol with profound significance, encompasses various cultural connotations and emotional meanings. In Chinese culture, the moon is associated with beauty, elegance, and auspiciousness, often appearing in poetry and literature.</p>
<p>However, as an observation log, perhaps we need to include some more scientific aspects.</p>
<p>During the process of revolving around the Earth, the Moon&rsquo;s appearance from Earth changes due to variations in our perspective and the lunar surface&rsquo;s rotation. This gives rise to phenomena such as the waxing and waning phases of the Moon.</p>
<p>In addition to the changes in shape, the color of the Moon also varies due to different atmospheric and cloud conditions. I have seen the Moon appear reddish, yellowish, and even greenish.</p>
<p>Many times, the Moon is surrounded by clouds and mist, creating a ethereal beauty, feeling as if it is floating in the sky. I love these moments and have captured many pictures with my phone. My phone can zoom up to 50x, allowing me to capture the shadows on the Moon. which is wonderful.<br>
